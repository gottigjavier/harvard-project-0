# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The project contains four html files in English and their identical versions in Spanish.

Bootstrap 4 was used, with additions of its own css, for the navigation bar of the eight files and for the first table of the Wuxing.

All local css was written to an scss file and compiled to css using Prepros.

It is the preference of this inexperienced student to use "class" selectors instead of another type of selector.

To meet project specifications, html tags and ID selectors were used, which could perhaps be considered far from good practice.

The content is not intended to instruct the reader but to be functional for the project. Rather, it aims to make the reader look for more information on the subject.

For this, and to quote the source, the external link was included.
